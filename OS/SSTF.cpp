/*Using a programming language of your choice, implement the SSTF algorithm. You will use a queue to store the 
next location to move the disk head. Randomly generate these numbers. Place 50 of them in the queue and then 
let the algorithm run. Finally, as the output let it print the total movement in the number of cylinders. 
Properly comment/document your code.*/
